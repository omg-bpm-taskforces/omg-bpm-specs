# OMG BPM+ Specifications
Monorepo for the machine-readable files of the BPM+ ecosystem of specifications
that has been developed at the Object Management Group (OMG).
This repo focuses on the SCE-based specifications:

* [Specification Common Elements (SCE)](https://www.omg.org/spec/SCE)
* [Shared Data Model and Notation (SDMN)](https://www.omg.org/spec/SDMN)
* [BPM+ Knowledge Package Model and Notation(BKPMN)](https://www.omg.org/spec/BKPMN)
* [Pedigree and Provenance Model and Notation (PPMN)](https://www.omg.org/techprocess/meetings/schedule/PPMN_RFP.html)

As dependencies it also includes:

* [Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN)
* [Decision Model and Notation (DMN)](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN)
* [Case Management Model and Notation (CMMN)](https://www.omg.org/spec/CMMN)

## Tools
For editing XML Schemas it es recommended to use an XML editor with [built-in validation](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml/blob/master/docs/Validation.md#validation-with-xsd-grammar),
e.g. the [VS Code extension for XML Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-xml)
or [XML Copy Editor](https://xml-copy-editor.sourceforge.io/).

An [XML calatog](catalog.xml) is provided for tools to know the schema locations for the namespaces, e.g. in [VS Code](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml/blob/master/docs/Validation.md#xml-catalog-with-xsd).

You can also associate language-specific file extensions to be treated as XML to enable schema validation, e.g. in VS Code:
```json
"files.associations": {
  "*.bpmn": "xml",
  "*.cmmn": "xml",
  "*.dmn":  "xml",
  "*.sdmn": "xml",
  "*.kpmn": "xml"
}
```

A [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/main.yml) is used to validate examples against XML schemas as a test for bot schemas as well as examples.
