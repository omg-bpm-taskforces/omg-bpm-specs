			<xsd:documentation>
				A BKPMNPackage is mechanism for packaging and distributing a set of BPM+ models (i.e., the knowledge). A BKPMNPackage references separate, 
				but connected BPM+ models (BPMN Processes, CMMN Cases, and DMN Decision Services). It should be noted that BKPMN is focused solely on the 
				BMI behavioral standards. A BKPMNPackage also contains a Data Item library for the data that will be used by the BPM+ models 
				(the proposed standard SDMN defines the elements of the Data Item library).

							This property is set to true when a Knowledge Package contains a complete and coherent set of models. This means that all the models 
							that are referenced by the Manifest are completed and the dependencies (relationships) between those models are well defined. 
							Further, all the dependencies (relationships) between Knowledge Package elements and the referenced models are also well defined – 
							these dependencies SHALL be validated before the property can set to true. When completed is still false (the default setting), 
							a Knowledge Package can still be discovered and/or distributed, but there is no expectation that the Knowledge Package is valid, 
							complete, or ready to use in practice.

							This property is set to true when a Knowledge Package is “officially” published and available for review and consumption. This is analogous 
							to the publishing of a book or the release of a version of software. The completed property SHALL be true before published property can set to true.
							When set to true, the content of the Knowledge Package, both internal and referenced, is considered immutable (locked). This includes the 
							versionDate of the Knowledge Package. When the version of the Knowledge Package is updated, then the published property is reset to false.
							Beyond the validation that applies to the complete property, there is no specify mechanism to validate that a Knowledge Package is 
							fully suitable for publishing. The Knowledge Package development team will determine when it is at a level of completeness that warrants 
							setting published to true. When published is still false (the default setting), a Knowledge Package can still be discovered and/or distributed, 
							but there is no expectation that the Knowledge Package is valid, complete, or ready to use in practice.
